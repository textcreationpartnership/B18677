            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE CASE of the Innholders, <hi>Of the City and Liberty of</hi> Westminster, <hi>and of the Parishes of St.</hi> Giles<hi>'s in the Fields, and St.</hi> Andrew<hi>'s</hi> Holborn, <hi>in the County of</hi> Middlesex.</head>
            <p>THAT the Innholders here in Town, being at much greater Charges for all sorts of Provisions and necessaries, and pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing greater Rents by far for their Houses, than those living in the Country; It was therefore thought reasonable by the late Queen (of blessed memory) who accordingly gave order that 8d. <hi>per</hi> night for Hay should be allowed and paid to the said Innholders living in Town, from each Trooper of the Earl of <hi>Oxfords</hi> Regiment, to be Quarter'd on them, the which said Order was confirm'd by his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Majesty since the Decease of his said Royal Consort.</p>
            <p>Notwithstanding which several of the Officers will only pay the said Innholders 6d. <hi>per</hi> night for each Trooper, tho' they have the attendance of Servants as others, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to wait on them, and the use of Kitchens, Firing, Candle, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which proves a much greater Charge to the said Innholders than the 6d. <hi>per</hi> night allowed them.</p>
            <p>That the Innholders did formerly provide all Oates as well as Hay for the Horses of His Majesties Guards that were Quarter'd with them as Guests, but now the Officers do provide Corn for the Troopers in the Inns, and make Granaries of their Chambers, and do thereby much Impoverish them.</p>
            <p>That there are great numbers of Livery-Stables, for the most part kept in private places, who have most of them no Soldiers Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd on them, Notwithstanding the direction of a late Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in that behalf made: And that many of them have entertained Highwaymen, and Horses to Carry beyond Seas, and by reason of the retiredness of their Scituation, are more apt to harbour Highway<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men (and their Horses) and other ill affected Persons, than Publick Inns are or can be: And that most of them pay no Taxes nor bear any Office in the Parish; whereas contrarywise the Innkeepers pay all Duties, and are at great Expences in serving of Offices and other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, whilst their dayly bread is taken from them by such as keep Livery Stables.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>IT is therefore humbly pray'd that Care may be taken for the due Execution of the Act in force for the said Livery-Stables, to Quarter Troopers equally with the Innkeepers, and that such Troopers may be as Guest with them as formerly at</hi> 8d. per <hi>night, And that such further Redress may be given to the said Innholders in the matters aforesaid as shall be thought reasonable.</hi>
